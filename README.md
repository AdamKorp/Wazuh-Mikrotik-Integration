# Wazuh-Mikrotik-Integration
Deployment of open-source SIEM + EDR solution and integration with Mikrotik routers
Home Network Security: Wazuh + MikroTik Integration

Goal: Deploy Wazuh, a powerful open-source XDR/SIEM platform, on a home network and integrate it with MikroTik routers for enhanced security monitoring at a low cost.



Why Wazuh?

Wazuh is a free, open-source security platform that unifies Extended Detection and Response (XDR) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) capabilities. It provides:

‚úî Endpoint Security ‚Äì Malware detection, file integrity monitoring, and log analysis.

‚úî Threat Detection & Response ‚Äì Real-time alerts for suspicious activities.

‚úî Compliance Monitoring ‚Äì Helps meet security standards (NIST, CIS, GDPR).

‚úî Elastic Stack Integration ‚Äì Powerful dashboards for visualizing security events.



Why MikroTik?

MikroTik routers are affordable yet powerful, running RouterOS, a Linux-based OS with:

‚úî Firewall & Traffic Filtering ‚Äì Blocks unauthorized access.

‚úî Bandwidth Management ‚Äì Controls and prioritizes network traffic.

‚úî VPN & Hotspot Support ‚Äì Secure remote access and guest networks.

‚úî Logging & Monitoring ‚Äì Generates security-relevant logs for analysis.



Why This Integration?

By combining Wazuh‚Äôs advanced threat detection with MikroTik‚Äôs network control, you get:

üîí Enhanced visibility into network threats.

üì° Real-time monitoring of router security events.

üí∞ Enterprise-grade security at a low cost (perfect for home labs and SMBs).




Let‚Äôs Build It!

This project will guide you through:

1. Deploying Wazuh (server, indexer, dashboard).

2. Configuring MikroTik to forward logs to Wazuh.
  
3. Generating private&public key for ssh communication

4. Setting up alerts & dashboards for proactive security.



üîß Lab Setup

üõ°Ô∏è MikroTik Device:
Model: hAP ax2, 
OS: RouterOS 7.18.2

üíª Virtualization:
Host: Proxmox VE 8.2.4, 
VM: Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS, 
Resources:
8GB RAM, 
70GB disk storage


Step 1: Wazuh Installation

1. Download & Run the Installer


```curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.11/wazuh-install.sh && sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a```


This script automates the installation of Wazuh manager, indexer, and dashboard.

The -a flag installs all components (single-node deployment).


2. Disable Automatic Updates (Optional but Recommended for Lab Environments)


`sudo sed -i "s/^deb /#deb /" /etc/apt/sources.list.d/wazuh.list`


`sudo apt update`

Step 2: Configure Wazuh Dashboard & Secure Access
1. Reset the Default Password
Run the Wazuh password tool to set a secure password for the admin user:


`sudo bash /usr/share/wazuh-indexer/plugins/opensearch-security/tools/wazuh-passwords-tool.sh -u admin -p <YOUR_PASSWORD>`

‚ö†Ô∏è If you put a space before a command, it prevents that command from being saved in the shell's history. This is good security practice so that your plaintext password won't be visible in the history ‚ö†Ô∏è

2. Restart Dependent Services
   
Apply the changes by restarting Filebeat and the Wazuh Dashboard:



`sudo systemctl restart filebeat.service`

`sudo systemctl restart wazuh-dashboard.service`

3. Access the Wazuh Dashboard
   
Find your VM‚Äôs IP address:

Open a browser and navigate to: https://<YOUR_VM_IP>

Log in with: Username: admin and Password: <YOUR__UPDATED_PASSWORD>

If you see "Wazuh dashboard server is not ready yet":

Wait 1‚Äì2 minutes for services to initialize.

Check status with:
`sudo systemctl status wazuh-dashboard`

4. (Recommended) Create a Proxmox Snapshot
   
Before proceeding further, snapshot your VM in Proxmox:

Go to your Proxmox web interface. Locate the Wazuh VM and Click "Snapshot". Name it (e.g., Clean_Wazuh_Base).

Why?

Allows easy rollback if something goes wrong along the way!


Step 3: Configure Wazuh to listen on port 514

   
Edit the main configuration file: `sudo nano /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` and add:

`<!-- MikroTik Syslog Integration -->
<remote>
  <connection>syslog</connection>
  <port>514</port>
  <protocol>udp</protocol>     
  <allowed-ips>192.168.1.1</allowed-ips>  <!-- Your MikroTik's IP -->
  <local_ip>192.168.1.63</local_ip>       <!-- Wazuh server IP -->
</remote>`


Restart wazuh `sudo systemctl restart wazuh-manager`

Verify if Wazuh is listening: Install  `apt install net-tools` and run `sudo netstat -tuln | grep 514`

Step 4: Configure MikroTik Log Forwarding


Log into MikroTik via winbox and navigate to: System > Logging > Actions

Click "New" and create new action. Name: remote, Type: remote. Apply and then double click on newly created "remote action" to add adjust more settings. 

Remote Address: <Wazuh server IP>, Remote Port: 514, src address: <MikrotiK's IP>, Remote log format: BDS Syslog, Remote log protocol: UDP. > Apply > OK. 


2. Set Logging Rules for each log type to forward:

Go to System > Logging > Rules, Click "New"

Topics: Select one (e.g., critical), Action: remote > Click Apply > OK

Recommended Topics to Forward: critical, error, firewall, info, system, warning

Step 5: Verify Log Transmission
On Wazuh Server identify your network interface:

`ip a` (e.g., ens18)

Monitor incoming logs by running a command  `sudo tcpdump -i ens18 tcp port 514 -A` and simulate a failed Winbox login ‚Üí Logs should appear in tcpdump output.
